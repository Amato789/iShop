## About

An online store project in which I implemented a shopping cart using Django sessions, customer order registration, 
asynchronous tasks, social authentication, a comment system and wish list, a personal account page, a payment gateway, 
exporting orders to CSV and generating invoices to PDF, and a recommendation system.
